Although most of the course is done, the assingments are still missing (preference in having seen all course and leave for the end the assingments, given the limited chances to pass them). Missing assingments to be done during w/c 27.04.

2. duel - done
3. bus - done
4. robin-hood - missing
5. mission-impossible - missing
6. temperatures - done (most of it)

# Projects for prework IH Data Analytics
Within this project there are several folders that have coding problems to solve in Python that will help you to familiarize yourself with the language and its most common functions. Each folder contains a file to open with **jupyter notebook** that will guide you step by step so that you reach the solution.

## Suggested order according to the difficulty

1. snail-and-well
2. duel
3. bus
4. robin-hood
5. mission-impossible
6. temperatures
7. lyrics
8. rock–paper–scissors


## Tips

Clone this repository or work localy downloading the files. It is up to you.

## Q/A example

### Question

Question: How old are you if you were born in 1990?

### Answer
```
current = 2019
born = 1990
age = current - born
print ('Age =', age)
```
### Output
```
>>> Age = 29
```

Do as much as you can and good luck. In some cases the use of functions is recommended.
